bspwm configuration
===================================

This is (was) my bspwm setup, and I didn't want to lose all my configuration for it so here's basically what it does:

1. Start up bspwm from .xinitrc after logging in
2. Start up sxhkd for keyboard hotkeys. These require:
	- xbacklight
	- dmenu (pretty menu)
	- clementine (music player for internet radio)
	- nuvolaplayer (music player for Google Play Music)
	- urxvt (terminal)
	- parcellite (clipboard manager)
3. Create bspwm workspaces and a panel to indicate which workspaces
4. Create a pretty tray that blends in with the workspaces bar at the bottom
5. Run dunst for notification messages
6. Compton for shadows and transparency composition and stuff
7. Run feh with busy waiting to randomize a wallpaper every 15 minutes


The setup is pretty simple and doesnt involve a whole lot but I never got sleep mode working properly and I'm too lazy to get into it again because this is now considered OUT OF MY ATTENTION ZONE. So, I'm, again, making a new setup. This is what it looked like:
